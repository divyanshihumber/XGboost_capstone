# Capstone Project â€“ XGBoost: An Optimized Boosting Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation, code, and supporting files for our Capstone Project on **XGBoost**, completed as part of the Machine Learning (RNA) course.

# Project Overview

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm known for its speed and performance. This project explores how XGBoost works, compares it with Random Forest, and demonstrates its application on a real-world classification dataset.
