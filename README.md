# Capstone Project – XGBoost: An Optimized Boosting Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation, code, and supporting files for our Capstone Project on **XGBoost**, completed as part of the Machine Learning (RNA) course.

## 📌 Project Overview

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm known for its speed and performance. This project explores how XGBoost works, compares it with Random Forest, and demonstrates its application on a real-world classification dataset.

## 📁 Contents

- `xgboost_model.py` – Python code for training and evaluating the XGBoost model.
- `data/` – Contains the dataset used (or link if using sklearn datasets).
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, training, and visualization.
- `presentation/` – Final presentation slides (`.pptx`) for the project.
- `report.pdf` – Written report submitted for evaluation.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xgboost-capstone.git
   cd xgboost-capstone
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main script from the jupyter notebook capstone.ipynb
